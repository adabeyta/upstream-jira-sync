# upstream-jira-sync

Config-driven GitHub-to-Jira sync framework for teams doing upstream
contribution work. A nightly bot mirrors your team's activity in upstream
GitHub repos (PRs, issues, reviews) into your Jira project so engineers never
hand-maintain tickets for work that already lives on GitHub.

## What it does

- **AI PR-ticket matching.** An LLM matches each team member's open and merged
  PRs to their open Jira tickets. No fuzzy fallback: if the model is not
  confident, the PR is skipped explicitly (optionally with an email ping).
- **Status transitions.** PR lifecycle (draft, in review, changes requested,
  merged, closed) maps to four canonical states (`todo`, `in_progress`,
  `review`, `done`), which your config maps to your project's actual status
  names. Transitions are resolved by target status, never by transition name,
  so any workflow shape works.
- **Story point estimation.** Optionally estimates points for matched tickets
  and writes them to your instance's points field.
- **Auto-create from claimed issues.** When a team member claims an upstream
  issue ("I'll take this"), the bot can create a tracking ticket, summarize the
  issue into the description, and link everything, with LLM dedup against
  existing tickets.
- **Sprints (optional).** Date-math sprint tagging, a nightly sweep of open
  tickets into the current sprint, and rolling pre-creation of upcoming
  sprints on your board.
- **Weekly digest (optional).** Posts a summary of bot and review activity to
  a GitHub Discussion. Rendering is alphabetical or grouped by repo, never
  ranked by volume.
- **RFC container issues (optional).** Upstream issues titled `[RFC]`/`RFC:`
  become container issues (e.g. Epics); PRs referencing them are parented
  underneath.
- **Manual override respect.** Human edits in Jira are detected via the
  changelog and preserved until the PR moves to a new stage.

Every optional feature ships disabled and starts in `shadow` mode when
enabled: it logs exactly what it would do without writing. You flip each
feature to `auto` only after its shadow output looks right.

## The two-repo model

The framework is split from team data so it can be public and shared:

| Repo | Visibility | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| **upstream-jira-sync** (this repo) | public | All code, packaged default AI prompts, tests. Zero team-specific data; CI rejects tenant literals. |
| **your deployment repo** (from the [team template](../upstream-jira-sync-team-template)) | private | `config.yaml`, GitHub Actions workflows pinning a released framework version, secrets. No code. |

Fixes and features land here and every team picks them up by bumping one
pinned version tag. Team-specific values (Jira URL, project key, status names,
custom field ids, teams, prompts) live only in each deployment repo's config.

## Quickstart

Create a private repo from the deployment template and follow its onboarding
checklist. In short:

1. Fill in `config.yaml`: `jira_url`, `jira_project_key`, `status_map`,
   `github_repo`, `llm`.
2. Add secrets: a GitHub token, Jira service account credentials, the roster
   as the `ROSTER_YAML` secret, and one LLM provider's credentials.
3. Validate: `upstream-jira-sync check-config` (offline), then
   `upstream-jira-sync check-config --live` for an authenticated read-only
   preflight (Jira project reachable, `status_map` names exist in the
   workflow, custom fields exist, board reachable if sprints are enabled,
   GitHub token scopes).
4. First run in shadow: `upstream-jira-sync sync --dry-run --member some-handle`.
5. Enable features one at a time, shadow first, then `auto`.

## Run as a GitHub Action

This repo doubles as a composite GitHub Action; the `uses:` ref is the version
pin (the action pip-installs its own checkout, so ref and code cannot
disagree):

```yaml
- uses: YOUR_ORG/upstream-jira-sync@v0.1.0
  with:
    command: sync          # or check-config
    config: config.yaml    # default
    dry-run: "false"       # sync only
    # member: some-handle  # sync only: restrict to one roster entry
    # extras: vertex       # install extra for the Vertex AI provider
  env:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    JIRA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_EMAIL }}
    JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
    ROSTER_YAML: ${{ secrets.ROSTER_YAML }}
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

All inputs: `command`, `config`, `state-file`, `dry-run`, `member`,
`since-hours`, `live` (check-config preflight), `extras`, `python-version`.
Credentials always flow through `env`, never inputs. The deployment template's
workflows use this form; state caching stays in the calling workflow (see the
template's `sync.yml`). Pin exact tags until 1.0; from then on the floating
major tag (`@v1`) tracks compatible releases.

## CLI

```bash
upstream-jira-sync sync [--dry-run] [--member GITHUB_USERNAME] [--config PATH]
                   [--state-file PATH] [--since-hours N] [--mock-url URL]
upstream-jira-sync check-config [--config PATH] [--live]
```

- `--dry-run` logs every Jira write without making it.
- `--member` restricts the run to one roster entry (by GitHub handle).
- `--since-hours 336` overrides the poll window for a backfill.
- `--mock-url` routes GitHub, Jira, and LLM calls to a local mock server.

## Configuration reference

Copy `config.example.yaml` into your deployment repo as `config.yaml`. All
keys live under `settings:`. Secrets never go in this file (see
[Environment variables](#environment-variables)).

| `ROSTER_YAML` | Optional; the roster as a YAML string, overriding `roster_file` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required by `llm.provider: anthropic` |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | `llm.provider: vertex`; path to GCP credentials JSON |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | `llm.provider: vertex`; or set `llm.vertex_project` |

## LLM providers

Two providers ship with the package; both expose the same `complete()` surface
to the AI classes.

**anthropic** (default) calls the Anthropic Messages API directly.

```yaml
llm:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. No install extra needed.

**vertex** calls the same models through GCP Vertex AI with Application
Default Credentials.

```yaml
llm:
  provider: vertex
  model: your-vertex-model-id
  vertex_project: your-gcp-project-id
  vertex_region: us-east5
```

Install with the extra: `pip install "upstream-jira-sync[vertex]"`. Authenticate
via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or ambient ADC (e.g. workload identity).

**Third-party providers** plug in through the `upstream_jira_sync.llm` entry-point
group. A package exposing a class with
`__init__(settings: LLMSettings)` and
`complete(system, user_message, max_tokens) -> str` under that group becomes
selectable as `llm.provider: <entry-point-name>`.

## Privacy

- The roster maps GitHub handles to Jira assignee emails and should never be
  committed: supply it via the `ROSTER_YAML` env var, or keep `roster_file`
  gitignored (the deployment template does this by default).
- Logs reference GitHub handles only; Jira emails are never logged.
- Per-person attribution in the state file exists only under the `digest`
  namespace and only when the digest is enabled; core dedup keys carry no
  user attribution.
- No user-facing output ranks team members by activity volume.

## Development

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd upstream-jira-sync
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # add ,vertex to work on the vertex provider

python -m pytest tests/ -v       # all tests
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
```

Integration testing without real APIs uses the bundled mock server, which
simulates GitHub GraphQL/REST, Jira REST v3, and both LLM provider APIs:

```bash
python tests/mock_server.py      # starts on port 9999
upstream-jira-sync sync --config tests/fixtures/config.test.yaml \
    --mock-url http://localhost:9999 --dry-run
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR, in particular the
tenant-literal rule: this repo must stay free of any team-specific names,
hosts, field ids, or emails, and CI greps for leaks on every push.
